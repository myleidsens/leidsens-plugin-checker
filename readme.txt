Leidsens Plugin Checker is a free common user plugin that makes the process of activating/deactivating all or selected installed plugins, enabling/disabling plugin updates, replacing URLs and strings, and disabling/enabling plugin and theme editors from WordPress effortless. Now there is no need to get several plugins as you can perform all these tasks with Leidsens Plugin Checker in just a few clicks. 

== Description ==

Many of us are aware of the tedious task of manually selecting each plugin being used or installed on WordPress websites or on specific pages of sites to activate/deactivate or update them. It involves several steps like clicking on tabs, scrolling down to sections, selecting checkboxes individually, and selecting and confirming the actions to execute specific tasks. Also, when it comes to manually updating or replacing hundreds of URLs in the database, the time-consuming process becomes extremely painful and laborious, affecting productivity. 

If developers want to save hours of work or make better use of time to focus on creation when working on multiple projects at a time, then Leidsens Plugin Checker is what you need today.

**Why Use the Leidsens Plugin Checker Tool?**
Leidsens Plugin Checker comes with many useful features packed together that you may not find available in a single plugin in the market, including:

*  <strong>Activate or Deactivate all plugins or selected plugins:</strong> No more scrolling and selecting several checkboxes manually because we give you the power to activate or deactivate plugins with the least number of clicks. Just select the plugins from the input field, select the task you want to perform, and click. 

*  <strong>Disable or Enable update for all or selected plugins:</strong> You may not want to update selected plugins if some useful features are not available anymore with the new updates, if you need no further updates after you have customized, or if you don’t need specific updates because they add no value, or if simply there is a bad update that can have a conflict. Our tool enables you to disable all or selected plugin updates through a single form, instead of finding and selecting each plugin and doing it manually.

*  <strong>Replace URL in the database for pages, posts, or default base URL:</strong> With Leidsens Plugin Checker, you can skip the tiresome process of bulk changing the URLs manually when migrating your WordPress website to a new server, moving the site to another domain, or changing directories on the same server, or shifting from HTTP to HTTPS. Simply select “URL Replace” from the left menu panel of our plugin, fill in the input fields, hit the task button, and you are all set.

*  <strong>Disable or Enable WordPress Editor for plugin and theme:</strong> Our plugin also helps make the process of creating your WordPress website easier and improves security with this convenient and practical feature.
